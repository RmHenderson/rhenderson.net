### (2015) PLURACTIONAL DEMONSTRATIONS ###

Presented as invited talk at LENLS 2015. A paper based on this is currently under construction.

The term ideophone is used to pick out a distinguished class of words in a language that specialize in depicting sensory imagery (Dingemanse 2011, p. 25; 2012). The literature on the formal semantics of ideophones is scarce. This is, I think, due to challenges: (i) It is not at all clear how to formalize the distinction between descriptive meaning, which is at the foundation of truth-conditional semantics, and depictive meaning, which ideophones seem to traffic in, and (ii) the idiosyncractic specificity of ideophone meaning and their restricted (morpho)syntactic distribution presents obstacles for doing formal lexical semanticsin particular, it's hard to compare them with expressions from more familiar categories and it's hard to determine their type. The goal of this paper is to address both of these problems, and in doing so, begin to develop a formal semantics of ideophones that can account for their meaning and compositional properties. To solve the first problem, I show that the core properties of ideophones can be treated in a demonstration-based framework first developed to account for be like-quotation and iconic phenomena in sign languages (Davidson to appear). I then use this analysis to diagnose and analyze two kinds of ideophonic pluractionality, which shows the semantic utility of the proposed account, and addresses the second problem by showing that pluractionality is a hook that can be used to generalize over types of ideophone meaning.
