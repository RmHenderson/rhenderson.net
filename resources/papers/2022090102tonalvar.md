Uspanteko (Mayan) is unique among the languages of Guatemala in having a 
full-fledged system of lexical tone. Tone is thoroughly integrated into 
the morphology of the language, and triggers several predictable 
phonological alternations. The Uspanteko tone system is also relatively 
simple, involving at most two contrastive categories. However, tone in 
Uspanteko shows a high degree of phonetic variability, and there is no 
consensus as to what tones are phonetically or phonologically active in 
the language. This paper argues that at least some of this unclarity 
owes to the effect of intonation, which can obscure lexical tone on 
vowels. A phonetic study attempting to control for intonation suggests 
that lexical tone in Uspanteko involves a privative [H]~0 contrast on 
short vowels, and either a [H]~0 or [H]~[L] contrast on long vowels. The 
relationship between the phonetics of tone and its low functional load 
in Uspanteko is also discussed.
