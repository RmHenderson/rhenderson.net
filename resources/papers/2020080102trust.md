### (2020) Social meaning in repeated interactions ###

With Elin McCready

Proceedings of Probability and Meaning Conference, Gothenburg 2020.

Judgements about communicative agents evolve over the course of interactions both in how individuals are judged for testimonial reliability and for (ideological) trustworthiness. This paper combines a theory of social meaning and persona with a theory of reliability within a game-theoretic view
of communication, giving a formal model involving interactional histories, repeated game models and ways of evaluating social meaning and trustworthiness.
