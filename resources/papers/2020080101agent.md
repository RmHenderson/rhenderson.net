### (2020) Towards functional, agent-based models of dogwhistle communication ###

With Elin McCready

Proceedings of Probability and Meaning Conference, Gothenburg 2020.

Henderson and McCready 2017, 2018, 2019 build a novel theory of so-called 'dogwhistle' communication by extending the social meaning games of Burnett 2017. This work reports on an ongoing project to build systems to model the evolution of dogwhistle communication in a population based on probability monads (Erwig and Kollmansberger, 2006; Kidd, 2007). The ultimate results will be useful not just for dogwhistles, but modeling the diffusion and evolution of social meaning in populations in general. The initial results presented here is a computational implementation of Henderson and McCready 2018, which will serve as the basis for models with multiple speakers and repeated interactions.
