<h4>MesoUD</h4>
<p>I am Co-PI on a multiyear NSF grant with Francis Tyers (Indiana) focused on developing syntactically annotated corpora of Mesoamerican languages. These will be paired with free and open-source natural language processing (NLP) pipeline models to automatically perform word segmentation, stemming, morphological analysis, and syntactic parsing for each of the above-listed languages, also made freely available in public-facing code repositories. We are additionally working on novel methods for identifying areal linguistic clusters in large multilingual language models, and for leveraging this information to bootstrap NLP systems for other Mesoamerican languages.</p>
