<h4>Compositional Morphosemantics of Plurality</h4>
<p>I am PI of a grant (with Co-PI Heidi Harley)  to document and analyze the morphosemantics of plurality across languages of the southwest, espectially Hiaki (yaq, Uto-Aztecan) and Seri (sei, Isolate). The project will investigate the semantics of plurality and pluractionality, as well as how it is morphologically encoded and compositionally interpreted. The primary research questions are (i) How do we implement pluractionality in a featureal system alongside nominal plurality to control the complex morphological systems we see in the target languages; (ii) How do we do compostional semantic interpretation below the level of the word in the opaque morphological systems of Seri, in particular (iii) What are the consequences of the plurality and pluractionality systems of Hiaki and Seri for morphological and semantic monotonicity of word formation operations; (iv) How do we reconcile suppletion for subject number in Seri with the broad typological generalization, exemplified in Hiaki, that verbal suppletion only occurs for object number?</p>
