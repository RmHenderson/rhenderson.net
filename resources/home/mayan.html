<h4>Mayan Syntax and Phonology</h4>
<p>I have worked on a series of problems on the K'ichean-branch Mayan languages lying outside of my core semantics specialty. I have a longstanding interest on ergativity in Mayan, especially the prohibition on WH-moving ergative arguments and how this interacts with binding phenomena. (I did a postdoc at McGill on this topic). I have also worked on how syntax is mapped to intonational phrases in K'ichee', and how this interacts with allomorphy in late-insertion theories of morphology like DM. I am currently working with Ryan Bennett on two projects (i) we are investigating whether absolutive morphology in Kaqchikel is affixal in virtue of head movement or prosodic conditions on word structure, (ii) we are working on the basic description and analysis of the distribution of lexical tone in Uspanteko, the only language in the K'ichean branch to have contrastive tone.</p>
