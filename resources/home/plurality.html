<h4>Plurality Across Domains</h4>
<p>I am interested in the following interlocked questions: (i) What sort of logic(s) do we need to model plural reference in natural language? (ii) How many varieties of plural reference are there? (ii) Do we find the same types of plural reference to individuals and events? For instance, a recent paper of mine addresses questions (i) and (ii) by proposing that a special class of indefinites in Mayan and other languages make reference to "evaluation pluralities" that are only definable in varieties of Dynamic Plural Logic. To address questions (ii) and (iii), another recent paper identifies a new type of plural reference for nouns and then shows that a common type of verbal pluractionality found in Mayan and other languages employs this type of plural reference in the event domain.</p>
