<h4>Village Sign Languages</h4>
<p>I am Co-PI on a joint CNRS-UA grant with Jeremy Kuhn and Carlo Geraci (CNRS) focused on village and emerging sign languages in Mesoamerica. There are a large number of small sign languages throughout Mayan-speaking region of Mesoamerica due to high rates of congenital deafness in various Maya communities (Le Guen 2019). Fox Tree 2009 documents how some of these sign languages, for example Meemul Tzij, used in the K'iche' Maya speaking area, incorporates pan-Maya gestures of arguably ancient origin (due to the fact that they are seen in Classic Maya inscriptions). The goal of this project is to document the pluractional systems of both Mayan sign languages, as well as co-speech gesture with pluractionals in spoken Mayan languages. </p>
