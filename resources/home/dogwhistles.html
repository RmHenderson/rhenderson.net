<h4>Dogwhistles</h4>
<p>In concert with Elin McCready at Aoyama Gakuin University in Tokyo, this research explores a type of pragmatic enrichment that has come to be called ``social meaning''. We have been exploring game theoretic approaches to social meaning through the use of dog-whistles in political speechâ€”namely, language that sends one message to an outgroup while at the same time sending a second (often taboo, controversial, or inflammatory) message to an ingroup. We identify for the first time two different kinds of dogwhistle meaning, show their connections to other kinds of pragmatic enrichment, and provide a game-theoretic account of dogwhistles and the evolutationary dynamics of their emergence into a language.</p>
