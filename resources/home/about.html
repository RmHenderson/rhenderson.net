<h2>Robert Henderson</h2>
<p>I am an Associate Professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona. My research is in formal semantics with a special focus on the indigenous languages of Mesoamerica (especially Mayan languages), languages on which I have done many years of fieldwork. I currently have three major research projects, though see my <a href="papers.html">papers</a> page (which includes handouts and work in progress!) for a full scope of my current research directions.</p>
