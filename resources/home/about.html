<h2>Robert Henderson</h2>
<p>I am an assistant professor of linguistics at the University of Arizona. My research is in formal semantics with a special focus on the indigenous languages of Mesoamerica (especially Mayan languages), languages on which I have done many years of fieldwork. I currently have three major research projects, though see the LLaMa group for more information and research directions.</p>
