<h4>Ideophones and Plurality</h4>
<p>I have been exploring the semantics of ideophones. After building a novel account of ideophones based on recent work on the semantics of iconicity in sign languages (Davidson 2015), I show through two detailed case studies of ideophones in two Mesoamerican languages, that there are two kinds of plurality in the ideophone domain that have never been discussed before. This work not only extends my thinking on plurality to new empirical domains, it opens up a new research program on formal approaches to iconicity in spoken language and allows us to compare parallels between spoken and signed languages that have not yet been explored.</p>
