<h4>Structuring Dynamic Updates</h4>
<p>I have a second major research program in dynamic semantics. In particular, I am interested in the way that the relevant logics can allow expressions to be interpreted incrementally in-situ, but seemingly affect their update at a distance. For instance, I've done work with Adrian Brasoveanu and Scott AnderBois on a theory of appositives that allows them to be interpreted in place, but still impose their update on the context before the at-issue content. Analogously, in my work on dependent indefinites and evaluation plurality, I have worked on post-suppositions in dynamic semantics, which are conditions that can be introduced locally by quantifiers, but which act to structure quantificational alternatives at the edge of quantificational domains.</p>
